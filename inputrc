# Specifies the duration readline will wait for a character when reading an
# ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using the
# input read so far, or can take additional input to complete a longer key
# sequence). If no input is received within the timeout, readline will use the
# shorter but complete key sequence. The value is specified in milliseconds, so
# a value of 1000 means that readline will wait one second for additional
# input. If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a
# non-numeric value, readline will wait until another key is pressed to decide
# which key sequence to complete.
# Set to 35 ms because with the default value of 500 hitting escape while in
# vi-insert mode would take a noticeable amount of time and make the shell
# *feel* unresponsive.
